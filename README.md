## My Projects/Repositories

## Bigger ones

### [AGH.Train-thesis-project](https://gitlab.com/komidawi/Agh-Train)

*System for optimizing seat allocation on trains*<br />
Bachelor of Science Thesis Project, AGH, 2021

This is so far the biggest non-commercial project I've taken part in. It is a configurable system to optimize seat allocation on passenger trains - a use case example would be passenger seating restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Another important functionality is optimization of the seat assignment process for efficient use of logistical resources and increased passenger comfort.<br />
Technologies: Kotlin, Ktor, Ktor-OpenAPI-Generator, Kotest, Mockk, JWT, RAPTOR, Jackson, Gradle

### [PizzaCostCalculator](https://github.com/komidawi/PizzaCostCalculator)
Handy Android app which helps to make an optimal decision when choosing pizza size and shape.<br />
Project focused on high code quality and proper coding and Android architecture practices. Much code written with TDD, high coverage levels. Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests. CI/CD made with Bitrise. SonarQube and CodeCov for metrics.<br />
I wanted to make it the best way possible, taking no half measures and being a contrary to commercial projects limited by deadlines and other business factors.<br />
Technologies: Kotlin, Room, JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, Gradle

## Smaller ones
### [MyDinner](https://github.com/komidawi/My-Dinner)
Recipe management Android app made during "Object-Oriented Technology 1" classes (AGH, VI summer semester 2019/20)<br />
Initially started in Java with legacy tech stack, later converted to modern Kotlin Fragments, Navigation component and MVVM Android architecture. The goal was to learn how to write Android apps.<br />
Technologies: Android, Kotlin, Gradle, Fuel, Gson

### [PostgreSQL-Classes](https://github.com/komidawi/PostgreSQL-Classes)
PostgreSQL and PL/pgSQL exercises made during "Databases" classes (AGH, III winter semester, 2018/19)<br />
Although it's not a project, this repository is still helpful in my everyday programmer life as a reference showing usage of queries or procedures (functions).

### [PlatformPythonGame](https://github.com/komidawi/Platform-Python-Game)
A simple, yet fully playable platform game made with PyGame during "Introduction to Computer Science" classes (AGH, I winter semester, 2016/17)<br />
It was the first project I have ever made. Although it's mostly just modified tutorial code, I like it as it's memento of my start with the "real IT world" adventure.<br />
Technologies: Python, PyGame, tilemap
